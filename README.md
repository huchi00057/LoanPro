Loan Risk and Repayment Analysis Optimization

### Motivation
Wealthy individuals often prefer debt, but how do banks continue to make money and avoid bankruptcy? If a company borrows a large sum and fails to repay due to bad investments, will the bank go bankrupt as well? What repayment rates and loan disbursement levels are necessary for banks to stay operational?

### Business Questions
1. Which types of loans or months have the highest repayment rates?
2. When is the loss rate highest, and how can it be prevented?
3. How can we improve the alignment between loan disbursement and repayment?
4. How can we optimize loan products to improve overall financial health?
