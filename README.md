Loan Risk and Repayment Analysis Optimization

### Motivation
Wealthy individuals often prefer debt, but how do banks continue to make money and avoid bankruptcy? If a company borrows a large sum and fails to repay due to bad investments, will the bank go bankrupt as well? What repayment rates and loan disbursement levels are necessary for banks to stay operational?

### Business Questions
1. Which types of loans or months have the highest repayment rates?
2. When is the loss rate highest, and how can it be prevented?
3. How can we improve the alignment between loan disbursement and repayment?
4. How can we optimize loan products to improve overall financial health?

### Project Overview: Jesse and Cece's Analysis at FinScope Analytics

Jesse and Cece, senior data analysts at FinScope Analytics, were commissioned by ProsperLoans Bank to assess its loan portfolio, aiming to identify growth opportunities while mitigating risks.

#### Understanding Disbursement Trends
Their analysis begins with loan disbursement trends to determine if loan volumes align with market demand or require adjustments. By identifying seasonal patterns and peak periods, they aim to optimize lending strategies for maximum profitability.

#### Assessing Repayment Performance
Next, Jesse and Cece evaluate repayment trends to determine whether borrowers are meeting their obligations. This analysis will help uncover potential repayment gaps and inform strategies for improving collection rates.

#### Balancing Profitability and Risk
The team then examines profitability versus loss rates to ensure that high-risk borrowers are not eroding overall profits. Jesse suspects that certain borrower segments may be contributing disproportionately to losses, necessitating stricter lending criteria or risk-adjusted interest rates.

By leveraging SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization, Jesse and Cece develop actionable insights to help ProsperLoans optimize loan disbursement, enhance repayment strategies, and strengthen financial sustainability.
